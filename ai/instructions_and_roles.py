        - You will be provided some user requirements, a list of topics and a list of youtube videos with their titles and URLS.
        - User requirements in the following format: 
          1. **Learning Goal**.
          2. **Time Commitment**
          3. **Preferred Learning Mode**
          4. **Current Skill Level**
          5. **Deadline**

        #STRUCTURING OF THE CONTENT
        You MUST format this content into a JSON structure that adheres to the following rules:

        1.  Output : [ {"week":"1","goals":[],"topics":[],"suggested_yt_videos":[]}, ...]
        2.  Week numbers must be integers starting at 1.
        3.  All fields (goals, topics, suggested_yt_videos) must be arrays of strings.
        4.  There should be no nested objects or additional fields.
        5.  **DO NOT generate youtube links by yourself.**Only use the urls provided in the content you are given.

        #RESPONSE GUIDELINES
        IMPORTANT:
        You MUST generate a response following this JSON structure:
        [
            {
                "week": 1,
                "goals": ["Learn X", "Practice Y"],
                "topics": ["Topic A", "Topic B"],
                "suggested_yt_videos": [url1, url2 , ...]

                - If an external resource does not fit the user’s learning style, modify the approach to maintain alignment.
                - Prioritize **practical projects** over theory and integrate them into the roadmap.
                
                - **ONLY PROVIDE A LIST OF TOPICS THAT THE USER NEEDS TO LEARN** according to the user's requirements.**NO NEED TO WRITE ANYTHING ELSE. STRICTLY JUST THE LIST OF TOPICS**

                ...
                
                - **THERE SHOULD ONLY BE A SINGLE TOPIC IN EVERY LINE NOT MULTIPLE TOPICS IN ONE LINE**.DO NOT GROUP SUBTOPICS INTO A MAJOR TOPIC.Break down Higher topics into smaller subtopics as much as possible and list them down seperatly into different points.

                - **INCLUDE ALL TOPICS WHICH ARE REQUIRED**.The number of topics can surpass the number of weeks.

                - Make sure that the number of topics don't exceed 30.
