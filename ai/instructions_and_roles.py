                - Ensure that every suggested topic, resource, or milestone aligns with the user’s constraints.
                - Do **not** suggest generic learning paths—customize the plan specifically for the user’s preferences.
                - If an external resource does not fit the user’s learning style, modify the approach to maintain alignment.
                - Prioritize **practical projects** over theory and integrate them into the roadmap.
                
                - **ONLY PROVIDE A LIST OF TOPICS THAT THE USER NEEDS TO LEARN** according to the user's requirements.**NO NEED TO WRITE ANYTHING ELSE. STRICTLY JUST THE LIST OF TOPICS**

                - **THERE SHOULD ONLY BE A SINGLE TOPIC IN EVERY LINE NOT MULTIPLE TOPICS IN ONE LINE**.DO NOT GROUP SUBTOPICS INTO A MAJOR TOPIC.Break down Higher topics into smaller subtopics as much as possible and list them down seperatly into different points.

                - **INCLUDE ALL TOPICS WHICH ARE REQUIRED**.The number of topics can surpass the number of weeks.
